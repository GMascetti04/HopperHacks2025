## Inspiration
We wanted to create a fun and engaging way to help people stay focused and motivated while working on their tasks. We and many of our friends struggle with procrastination, and we thought, what better way to stay on track than having a favorite celebrity cheer you on? By combining productivity with entertainment, we designed an experience that makes staying focused more enjoyable.

## What it does
Celebrity Motivator allows users to select a celebrity of their choice to encourage them while using a focus timer. Users can input a short description of their task, and our system utilizes Llama to generate personalized motivational messages as if the celebrity were speaking directly to them. The goal is to boost productivity in a fun and personalized way.

## How we built it
We developed the website using modern web technologies, integrating the Llama model to generate realistic celebrity-style messages for a more engaging and authentic experience. The timer feature ensures users stay on task, while the celebrity motivation messages are generated dynamically based on user input and can be refreshed upon user interaction.

## Challenges we ran into
- Fine-tuning celebrity messages to match their unique tone and style
- Integrating ollama smoothly with our system
- Ensuring the timer and motivational messages work seamlessly together
- Optimizing performance to handle multiple requests efficiently

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Successfully creating a fun, functional, and user-friendly productivity tool
- Implementing realistic celebrity-style responses using AI and an LLM
- Building a smooth and engaging user experience
- Overcoming integration challenges to make everything work seamlessly

## What we learned
- How to better utilize AI models for dynamic content generation
- The importance of user experience in encouraging usage
- How to balance fun and productivity in a single platform

## What's next for Celebrity Motivator
- Expanding the selection of celebrities with even more accurate voice and tone matching
- Introducing voice-generated motivational messages for an even more immersive experience
- Adding more customization options for users, such as different timer settings and background themes
- Exploring mobile app development to make Celebrity Motivator even more accessible
- Implementing user accounts and tracking streaks
